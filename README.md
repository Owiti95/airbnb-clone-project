# airbnb-clone-project

Project Overview
Airbnb Clone is a full-stack web application inspired by the popular booking platform, Airbnb. This project simulates a real-world software development workflow, focusing on core aspects of backend development, database architecture, API design, and CI/CD integration. Built with a focus on scalability, security, and collaborative development, it provides a comprehensive learning experience for aspiring developers.

Project Goals
Recreate key functionalities of Airbnb, such as user authentication, property listings, and booking systems.

Practice collaborative software development using GitHub.

Apply best practices in backend development, API security, and CI/CD pipelines.

Design and document scalable, relational databases reflecting real-world use cases.

Integrate modern technologies to create a cohesive, production-ready application.

Tech Stack
Backend Framework: Django

Database: MySQL

API: RESTful and GraphQL

Version Control & Collaboration: Git & GitHub

Deployment & CI/CD: Docker, GitHub Actions

Team Roles

Backend Developer

Responsible for designing and implementing the server-side logic, API endpoints, and integration of third-party services. This role also involves managing the structure of the Django project, enforcing security practices, and aligning the backend logic with frontend and database requirements.

Database Administrator (DBA)

Focuses on the design, creation, and maintenance of the MySQL database. Responsibilities include writing optimized queries, ensuring data integrity, managing relationships between tables, setting up backups, and fine-tuning database performance through indexing and normalization.

DevOps Engineer

Manages the continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) pipelines using tools like GitHub Actions and Docker. This role ensures smooth deployments, infrastructure monitoring, version control workflows, containerization, and scaling of the backend environment to support real-world demands.

QA Engineer

Responsible for testing all backend functionalities including API endpoints, data validation, and error handling. The QA Engineer writes automated test cases, conducts performance and security testing, and ensures the application meets predefined acceptance criteria and quality benchmarks.

Technology Stack

Django

A high-level Python web framework used to build the backend of the application. It enables rapid development of secure and maintainable web APIs and handles routing, authentication, and business logic.

MySQL

A relational database management system used to store and manage structured data such as user accounts, property listings, booking details, and transaction records. It supports robust querying, relationships, and indexing.

GraphQL

An advanced API query language used to enable flexible and efficient client-server data communication. It allows clients to request exactly what they need, minimizing over-fetching or under-fetching of data.

Docker

A containerization tool used to package the application and its dependencies into portable containers. It ensures consistency across development, testing, and production environments.

Git & GitHub

Version control and collaboration tools used to manage source code, track changes, and enable team collaboration via pull requests, issues, and branching workflows.

GitHub Actions

A CI/CD automation platform used to build, test, and deploy the application automatically on code commits. It helps maintain code quality and streamlines the release process.

API Security Tools

Includes authentication (e.g., JWT) and authorization mechanisms to protect endpoints, secure data transactions, and ensure safe access control within the application.
