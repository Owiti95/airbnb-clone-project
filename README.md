Team Roles

Backend Developer

Responsible for designing and implementing the server-side logic, API endpoints, and integration of third-party services. This role also involves managing the structure of the Django project, enforcing security practices, and aligning the backend logic with frontend and database requirements.

Database Administrator (DBA)

Focuses on the design, creation, and maintenance of the MySQL database. Responsibilities include writing optimized queries, ensuring data integrity, managing relationships between tables, setting up backups, and fine-tuning database performance through indexing and normalization.

DevOps Engineer

Manages the continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) pipelines using tools like GitHub Actions and Docker. This role ensures smooth deployments, infrastructure monitoring, version control workflows, containerization, and scaling of the backend environment to support real-world demands.

QA Engineer

Responsible for testing all backend functionalities including API endpoints, data validation, and error handling. The QA Engineer writes automated test cases, conducts performance and security testing, and ensures the application meets predefined acceptance criteria and quality benchmarks.

Technology Stack

Django

A high-level Python web framework used to build the backend of the application. It enables rapid development of secure and maintainable web APIs and handles routing, authentication, and business logic.

MySQL

A relational database management system used to store and manage structured data such as user accounts, property listings, booking details, and transaction records. It supports robust querying, relationships, and indexing.

GraphQL

An advanced API query language used to enable flexible and efficient client-server data communication. It allows clients to request exactly what they need, minimizing over-fetching or under-fetching of data.

Docker

A containerization tool used to package the application and its dependencies into portable containers. It ensures consistency across development, testing, and production environments.

Git & GitHub

Version control and collaboration tools used to manage source code, track changes, and enable team collaboration via pull requests, issues, and branching workflows.

GitHub Actions

A CI/CD automation platform used to build, test, and deploy the application automatically on code commits. It helps maintain code quality and streamlines the release process.

API Security Tools

Includes authentication (e.g., JWT) and authorization mechanisms to protect endpoints, secure data transactions, and ensure safe access control within the application.

#Database Design

The database for the Airbnb Clone project is designed with normalization and scalability in mind. It captures key relationships between users, properties, bookings, payments, and reviews to mirror a real-world booking platform.

Users

Represents individuals using the platform (hosts and guests).

Key Fields:

id: Unique identifier for each user

name: Full name of the user

email: User’s email address (used for login)

password_hash: Hashed password for secure authentication

is_host: Boolean indicating if the user is a property owner

Relationships:

A user can create multiple properties (if is_host is True)

A user can make multiple bookings

A user can leave multiple reviews

Properties

Represents listings available for booking.

Key Fields:

id: Unique identifier for each property

title: Name or title of the property

description: Detailed description of the property

price_per_night: Cost per night

host_id: Foreign key referencing the Users table

Relationships:

A property is owned by one user (host)

A property can have many bookings

A property can receive many reviews

Bookings

Tracks reservations made by users.

Key Fields:

id: Unique identifier for each booking

property_id: Foreign key referencing the Properties table

user_id: Foreign key referencing the Users table

check_in: Start date of booking

check_out: End date of booking

Relationships:

A booking belongs to one user and one property

A booking may be linked to one payment

Payments

Handles financial transactions related to bookings.

Key Fields:

id: Unique identifier for each payment

booking_id: Foreign key referencing the Bookings table

amount: Total payment amount

payment_status: Status (e.g., “completed”, “pending”)

payment_date: Timestamp of payment

Relationships:

Each payment is linked to a single booking

Reviews

Captures user feedback on properties.

Key Fields:

id: Unique identifier for each review

user_id: Foreign key referencing the Users table

property_id: Foreign key referencing the Properties table

rating: Numeric rating (e.g., 1–5)

comment: Written feedback

Relationships:

Each review is associated with one user and one property

Entity Relationships Summary

One User → many Properties, Bookings, Reviews

One Property → many Bookings, Reviews

One Booking → one Payment

One User can review multiple Properties, but only once per booking

#Feature Breakdown

1. User Management
This feature enables secure user registration, authentication, and profile management. It ensures that users can create accounts, log in, and maintain personal profiles, forming the foundation for personalized interactions within the platform.

2. Property Management
Hosts can list new properties, update listing information, and remove properties when needed. This feature supports full CRUD operations, enabling seamless management of rental units and contributing to a diverse marketplace.

3. Booking System
Users can make reservations, view booking details, and manage check-ins and check-outs. This system ensures that booking flows are smooth, accurate, and reflect real-time availability.

4. Payment Processing
Handles transactions related to property bookings, including payment initiation and confirmation. This feature ensures secure and reliable payment flow, which is crucial for trust and operational continuity.

5. Review System
Enables users to leave reviews and rate properties they have stayed in. Reviews foster trust in the community and help maintain quality standards across the platform.

6. API Documentation
The backend is well-documented using the OpenAPI standard, allowing developers to easily integrate with the system. It includes both REST and GraphQL APIs for flexibility and comprehensive access to resources.

7. Database Optimizations
Indexes and caching strategies are implemented to improve query performance and reduce server load. This ensures that the system remains responsive and scalable as data grows.

#API Security
Ensuring the security of backend APIs is essential to protect sensitive data, maintain system integrity, and build user trust. The following key security measures will be implemented in the Airbnb Clone project:

1. Authentication
Authentication ensures that only registered users can access protected endpoints. Using secure methods like JWT (JSON Web Tokens) or session-based authentication, we validate user identity before granting access to critical features like bookings, payments, and profile management.

Why it matters: Prevents unauthorized access to user accounts and protects personal data from being exposed.

2. Authorization
Authorization restricts access to resources based on user roles and permissions. For instance, only the host who listed a property should be able to update or delete it, and users should only be able to manage their own bookings.

Why it matters: Ensures users can only perform actions on resources they own or are allowed to access, thereby reducing the risk of privilege escalation.

3. Rate Limiting
Rate limiting controls the number of API requests a client can make within a specific timeframe. This prevents abuse such as brute force attacks and helps maintain server performance under high traffic.

Why it matters: Protects the platform from spam, abuse, and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks.

4. Data Validation & Sanitization
Input data is validated and sanitized before processing. This prevents injection attacks such as SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS).

Why it matters: Keeps the system safe from malicious input that could compromise data or application logic.

5. Secure Payment Handling
All payment-related data is transmitted over HTTPS and processed using secure, PCI-compliant payment gateways. Sensitive details like card numbers are never stored on the server.

Why it matters: Safeguards financial information and ensures compliance with payment security standards.

6. HTTPS and Secure Headers
All communications between the client and server are encrypted using HTTPS. Security headers like Content-Security-Policy and Strict-Transport-Security are also applied to minimize attack vectors.

Why it matters: Prevents eavesdropping, man-in-the-middle attacks, and other network-level threats.
